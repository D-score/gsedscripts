# Solution on LF Item Order Issue
 

## Problem
 
During the preparation of the software for the GSED Package I found persistent inconsistencies in the item labels of the GSED LF used in the Phase I validation study. With the help of Gareth, Michelle, Raghbir and others, it became gradually clear that the documentation and implementation were out of sync. As I understand it now, REDCAP implemented an older version of LF than documented. As a result, the labels of 34 out of 155 items did not match the administered item. The erroneous labels have been in the dscore package since May 30, 2022.
 
This report is a sequel to my previous post last Thursday that alerted project members to the problem, and to my exchange with Tarun and Vanessa last Friday.
 
## Impact
 
The item label is a fundamental building block in the GSED project. Errors in item labels are contagious: Any action or analysis that depends on the item label being correct could be in error.
 
The following parts are not affected:

- The numeric values from the GSED core model 293_0 using the combined SF and LF;
- The reference population `phase1` used to calculate the DAZ;
- The 18-item ECDI extension (since that depends on SF).
 
The following parts are affected:

- `dscore`: The central tables `builtin_itemtable` (item names and labels) and the `builtin_itembank` (item names and tauâ€™s);
- `dscore`: default key `gsed2208` is invalid for all instruments, except `gpa` (GSED SF);
- `gsedread`: Item name construction used for reading the Phase 1 LF (BGD, PAK, TZA) in ` scripts/assemble_data.R` and `scripts/edit_data.R` is invalid;
- `gsedread`: The translation between original, sequential, gsed and gsed2 lexicons (defined in `itemnames_translate.tsv`) is incorrect. Consequently, the function `rename_vector()` produces incorrect results.
- `gsedscripts`: tau estimates from model 818_6 are invalid;
- LF Phase 2 form: items per stream not sorted in difficulty.
 
In general, results calculated from GSED SF are safe. Results calculated from GSED LF are safe if these do not depend on the item label being correct.
 
## Actions taken
 
- `gsedread` updated to 0.8.0 <https://github.com/D-score/gsedread/>
- `dscore` updated to 1.7.0 <https://cran.r-project.org/package=dscore>
- `gsedscripts` update to 0.6.0  <https://github.com/D-score/gsedscripts>
- For detail, see <https://github.com/D-score/gsedscripts/blob/main/Rmd/Item_reorderings_action.qmd>
- For detail on model 818_6: <https://github.com/D-score/gsedscripts/blob/main/Rmd/item_comparson_2208_2212.qmd>. The updated 818_6 model is better than to old version.
 
## Recommendations
 
- Update your packages `dscore`, `gsedread` and `gsedscripts`
- Reread data with code `gto` (LF Phase I version) and reanalyse. If you used only `gpa` (SF Phase I version) you are safe.
- Rerun code using `gsedread::rename_vector()`
- Update any copies made or extracted from `dscore::builtin_itemtable`,  `dscore::builtin_itembank` or `gsedread::itemnames_translates.tsv`
- D-scores calculated from non-GSED instruments after May 30, 2022 need to be recalculated (differences are small in general) 
- Decide on what to do with LF Phase 2 item order. If necessary, update the corresponding `gl1` instrument code entries in `dscore`
- Perform extra check on new codes `gs1` (GSED SHORT FORM V1, to be released) and `gl1` (GSED LONG FORM V1, to be released)
- Be sure to keep the item code and item label in sync. Give a form a version number when item order changes, update both documentation and form, install bookkeeper role to approve the master version

## Conclusions

Fortunately, we caught and addressed the problem ahead of our first release. I assume that the above actions correct the problem. Although I have no wish to spend another week on this problem, please let me know if there are any further issues that need attention.
